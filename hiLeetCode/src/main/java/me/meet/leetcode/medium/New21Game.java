     * Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
     * Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
     * Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
     * Output: 1.00000
     *
     * Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
     * Output: 0.60000
     *
     * Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
     * In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
     *
     * Example 3:
     * Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
     * Output: 0.73278
     *
     * Note:
     * 1. 0 <= K <= N <= 10000
     * 2. 1 <= W <= 10000
     * 3. Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
     * 4. The judging time limit has been reduced for this question.
