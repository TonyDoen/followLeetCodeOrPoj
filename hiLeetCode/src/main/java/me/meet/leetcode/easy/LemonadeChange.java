    /**
     * At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5.
     * Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).
     * Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
     * Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.
     * Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
     * Output: true
     * <p>
     * Explanation:
     * From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
     * From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
     * From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
     * Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
     * <p>
     * Example 2:
     * Input: [5,5,10]
     * Output: true
     * <p>
     * Example 3:
     * Input: [10,10]
     * Output: false
     * <p>
     * Example 4:
     * Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
     * Output: false
     * <p>
     * Explanation:
     * From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
     * For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
     * For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
     * Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
     * <p>
     * Note:
     * 0 <= bills.length <= 10000
     * bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.
